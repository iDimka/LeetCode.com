 Given two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2, merge nums2 into nums1 as one sorted array.

 Note:

 The number of elements initialized in nums1 and nums2 are m and n respectively.
 You may assume that nums1 has enough space (size that is greater or equal to m + n) to hold additional elements from nums2.
 Example:

 Input:
 nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3
 nums2 = [2,5,6],       n = 3

 Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
    Hide Hint #1
 You can easily solve this problem if you simply think about two elements at a time rather than two arrays. We know that each of the individual arrays is sorted. What we don't know is how they will intertwine. Can we take a local decision and arrive at an optimal solution?
    Hide Hint #2
 If you simply consider one element each at a time from the two arrays and make a decision and proceed accordingly, you will arrive at the optimal solution.
